I'm a Senior Staff Scientist at Google X working on applied ML. Before this, I was a Principal Applied Scientist at Amazon. I'm resurrecting this blog after a decade of hiatus to write about random topics on applied ML, though if you scroll back far enough, you might stumble on a few ancient posts about random topics from my academic days.
